There are two classes, Chorobin to assign colors to quantities, and Chorogrid to make the maps.

Maps are made in SVG format; if you need to convert them to PNG you can do so in an external application like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator, or in python with CairoSVG among other solutions.

Since SVGs don't display in saved IPython Notebooks, here is an html version of Tutorial 2 so you can see the choropleths in all their glory:

Pro tip: it's "choropleth", not "chloropleth"; there's no L. The word comes from ancient Greek χώρα (khṓra, “location”) and πλῆθος (plêthos, “a great number”, same root as *plethora*), not χλωρός (khlōrós, “pale green”) as in *chlorine* and *chlorophyll*. Luckily Google knows the difference.
